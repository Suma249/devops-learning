AWS cloud provider
if we need virtual machine, from aws console will make request to the virtual machine, in repose aws would send created virtual machine's configuration details
and same happens with Azure cloud provider

above method is a manual method creating a virtual machine on cloud provider

but to improve the efficiency, we will use automation that is provided aws called aws ec2 api
so using automation, user who wants to create a virtual machine he will write a script, and usig this script he will make a call to aws ec2 api
he makes a call aws api and in the script he wil menrion the details for his ec2 instance

amazon dev people will expose the api of ec2 intance, and this api will recieve a rrqiest and if the request is in correct format it will send the ec2 instance configuration

script that devops writes can be
  1. through aws cli
  2. directly use the aws api
  3. aws cft
  4. terraform -> alternative to resource creation
  5. aws cdk

infrastructure or resource creation

creating an ec2 instance from aws
 1. go to services from aws console
 2. click pn ec2 under services
 3. in ec2 global view, click on launch instance
 4. after clicking on the launch instance, we have to provide few details 
     like ec2 name, operating system type, chhose instance type as free tier
    create a key value pair for login to ec2 instance, after providing key value details click on create key value pair
    key-value pair: allows us to login to ec2 instance, once aws ec2 instnce is created we will get a ip address but to login we need login credentials to access it so
   we use key-value pair
    than click on launch instance 
 5. and after few minutes, ec2 instances will be created

on azure
1. create instance -> virtual machine
