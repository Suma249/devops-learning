1. touch nodehealth.sh
2. vi nodehealth.sh
3. press esc+i, to get into insert mode
4. start a file with the command added #!/bin/bash
5. it is always important to mention the files details like author, version, descroption about teh file in comments

#!/bin/bash

#to know the disk space etails of the machine
df -h

#to know free mempry details of the machine
free -g

#to know number of cpu's of the macgine
nproc

6. chmod 777 nodehealth.sh
7. ./nodehealth.sh
8. we wont be able to undestand the output that we get from the abpve command because of the way we have written the shell script
so to improve
9. 
#!/bin/bash

#to know the disk space etails of the machine
echo "print the disk space"
df -h

#to know free mempry details of the machine
echo "print the memory"
free -g

#to know number of cpu's of the macgine
echo "print the cpu"
nproc

10. better way than using echo command. is using the comand set -x to make commands execute in debug mpde

#!/bin/bash

df -h

#to know free mempry details of the machine
free -g

#to know number of cpu's of the macgine

11. what are processes and system processes?
12. to know the processes that are running on the machine, ps -ef command is used
13. to know all the processe running on the system ps -ef, to know only proccesses run by a particulasr agent
  ps -ef | grep "agentName"
14. to get only proces id's, there atre many commands but most commonly used one is awk, need tolearn awk.
   ps -ef | grep "agetName" | awk -F " '{print $2}'
  what the above awk command is doing
  grep "text to search for" "source in which to search for text"
15. interview question,what is the output of date | echo "date is"?
ans : date comand snds ouptut to stdin, but pipe command receives ouptu only from the command that is previous to it
16. back to our code, to list process id's of specific agent
#!/bin/bash

set -x #debug mode
set -e #exits the script when there is an error,  
set -o pipe #drawback with set -e is it will not error out when there is an error with the pipe thats why set -o pipe, bevause it will check the last command of the pipe command
# above three comands can be written as well set -exo pipe

#to know the disk space etails of the machine
df -h

#to know free mempry details of the machine
free -g

Devops use case -> how to search errors in log file
1. logs files are usually very very large
   but logs are usually stored in external storage space, in such case we use curl command
  we have to prvide the abosolute url of the log file where it is stored
  curl command is used to retrieve resource from the internet
   wget -> similar to curl but wget wlll download the file where as curl will share the output
Find command
1. it will find the location of the input that we specify

sudo means substitute user do
su -> switch user

sudo su - : means sudo gives previlateges to run on behalf of root user

if else in shell scripting

1. vi ifElse.sh
2. press esc + i to enter into the insert mode
#!/bin/bash
a=10
b=10 
if [$a>$b]
then 
  echo "a is greater than b"
else 
  echo "b is greater than a"
fi

for loop in shell script

#!/bin/bash

for i in {1,100};
  do echo $i;
done


trap command
1. basically used for trapping signals
  signals?
  : there will be signaks passed to the linux, when executing the command like when we press ctrl+c where inernally stop signal is passed to the linux to stop the executing process
    there are multiple signals available in linux
   commonly used signals sigkill -> to kill the process, and some other
  syntax: trap "echo dont use the ctrl+c" SIGINT
