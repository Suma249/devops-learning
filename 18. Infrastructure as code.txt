open stack is used to create our own cloud on our servers

scenario1: when script is written applying to only aws cloud provider but due to some reasins if we have to shift from aws to azure 
al these scripts will be in vain

scenatrio 2: hybrid cloud model, where we can create part of our infrastructure on aws and part of our infrastructure on azure like for storage 
aws is used and for 
project related services azure is used, for these debops person has tolearn aws cft and azure resource manager which are called infrastructure as code

so this is where, terraform comes into help, where instead of learning all the other tools as explained in the above 2 scenarios

where we can learn scripts and terraform will automatically take care of automating the resiurce screation on cloud providers
terraform is a tool provided by hashicorp, terraform solves the problem of learning scripts specific to cloud provider and we can just write terraform scripts
irrespective of what the cloudprovider is, terraform will take care of automating resources on cloud, we just have to tell who our cloud provider
we can learn one toold and this tool will take care of infrastructure -> api as code

API as code: concept usimg which we can automate any provider using their api
terraform internally talk to the api of that particular cloud provider, terraform wull convert the script into the provider specific based on cloud provider mentioned
in the terraform scripts

API: using api, we can programatically talk to the application
terraform uses api of the cloud privider
terraform will automatically look at the cloud providers api, instead of developers talking to each cloud probifer api using 
tahtr spiecific langiage which is very troublesome
terraform will convert our request into api call, and as a user we are not talking to api of cloud provider
terraform will receive a user request and converts it into a API call

infrastructure as a code: automating infrastructure using tools like cft, azure resource mnager, etc.
api as code: terraform that is more efficient than the above one's
