self hosted runners:
if we are using jenkins, we can install jenkins and use another ec2 instance or docker container as runner
runner: a place where job gets run, in jenkins it is called agent or worker node (application gets run)
in github ction, these are classified into github hosted runners and self hosted runners
github hosted runner: when we build a ci project on github system, what happens is ci system is built on github
when we take a rinner from github, and execute out project on github runner itself
self hosted runner: 
in jenkins, to execute work uwe use worker nodes which can be ec2 instance or docker agent
if our project is private and runners provided by guithub are not enough for our project


practical
1. create an ec2 instance
2. configure inbound and outbound traffic rules for the created ec2 instance
   click on the security group of that instance, select inbound rules than click on edit inbound rules, add 2 rules to accept raffic from http and https
   save the changes and then go to outbound traffic rules
3. clone the github-actiond-zer-to-hero repo and push it onto my repo
4. under actions tab of my repo, under self hosted runner section aclick new runner and provide details of runner
   aftr providing runner details, details will be given to execute on runner and do that
5. update the actions file with  runs-on: self-hosted
6. and with this if there are any commits out repo this action will run
