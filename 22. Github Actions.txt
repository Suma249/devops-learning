github actions is yet another ci cd solution similar to jenkins but the primary difference is github actions is focused only on github just like gilab ci cd 
that is focused on gitlab, these are platform oriented solutions

for github actions we dont have to install any plugins, but to create a github actions goto the parent directory of ur repository
and create .github/workflow folder and once we do tht whatever action is inside this folder will be executed automstically on defined events for that action
we can have as many action files as we want and each action file is efined as the pipeline
action file is an yaml file

1. create a python function that takes a two integers as input and returns their sum and in the same file add the python function to unit test addition func
   nality
   def add(a,b):
     return a+b;
   def test_add():
    assert add(2,4) == 6;
    assert add(9,7) == 16
2. write a github action or pipeline that runs whenever there is a new commit thst is getting created, this action should checkout the code and
   it has to create a python environmrent for us
   name: my first github action
   on:[push]
   jobs: #can be correlated as pipeline in jenkins, in one file wecan have multiple piplines by hdefining multiple jobs
     build:
       runs-on:ubuntu-latest
       strategy:
         matrix:
           pthon-version:[3.8,3.9]
       steps:
       - uses: actions/checkout@v3
       - name:Set up Python
         uses:action/setup-python@v2
         with:
           python-version: ${{matrix.python.version}}
         
       - name: install dependencies
         run: |
           python -m pip install --upgrade pip
           pip install pytest
       - name: Run tests
         run: |
           cd src
           python -m pytest addition.py
