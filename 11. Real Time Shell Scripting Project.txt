shell scripting with github integration

we can talk to github using two ways
 1. API: application interface, talking to application via interface
 2. CLI

for github, api way of communicayion is simple
we can talk to application, only if the application exposes its application interface where we will run dome mopdules like using curl for shell scripting
using eithr http or https protocol

always use api documentation of that particular application on how to use api's

as a devips engineer, we will maintain lot of github repoitories i.e supporting different team 
will make sure proper access is granted , 
so, now we will write script to list of people who has access to the repository

ppk file for putty -> to access ec2 via putty we need to use ppk file instead of pem


script

#!/bin/bash

api_url="";

username=$username'
token=$token

repoOwner=$repoOwner
repoName=$repoName

function github_api_get(){
  local endpoint="$1"
  local url="${api_url}/{$endpoint}"
  curl -s -u "${username}:${tpekn}" "$url"
}

function list_users_with_read_access(){
  local endpoint="repos/${repoOwner}/${repoName}/collaborators";
  collaborators=$(github_api_get $ "endpoint" | jq -r '.[] | select
}
