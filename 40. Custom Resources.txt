in k8s cluster there are some resources that comes by defaultlike service, deployment, pod, etc.,

if we want to introduce new resource to the k8s or extending the api like k8s does not support advanced security problems, in such cases we can use
 crd, cr and custom controller
there re 2 actors here devops enginer and user
1. deploying the custome resoutrce definition and controller is the action od devopds engineer
2. deploying the custom resource can be ction of user or devops engineer

like we can use argicd to add gitops to k8s, or keyloack for user managment and many other resources that adds the functionality to k8s that does
not exist in it
k8s team told that there are only few reoirces that they support by default and if we wnat additional capabilities in k8s
they will allow us to extend the api of k8s or extend te capabilities of k8s

to extend the capabilities of k8s, there are 3 resources
1. crd
2. cr
3. custom controller

 custom resource definition i.e we(people who are addong the functionality to k8s) are defining the new type of API to k8s, for thatthey have to 
submit the custom resource definition to k8s. it is a yaml file with details of what user has to specify for this resource.
 crd is a yaml file that is used to introduce new type of API to k8s and that will have all the foelds that user can define in custom resource
 ex: as a user we are creating a deployment.yml file and in that we will specify the required details for deployment and 
 k8s has the resource definition in the API server or k8s controller manager that will validate if the user creatied deployment resource is correct or not
 user has submitted a custom resource that is validated again custom resource definition and custom resource is created inside our k8s cluster
 deployment controller wil create replica and replica set controller will create a pod and all this is done by k8s controller abd similarly
 there has to be a custom controller that is deployed in k8s cluster, so that once we deploy a custom resource, this custom controller will 
 watch for it and takes the required action

ex: devps engineers have deployed a virtual service crd in k8s cluster and dev or user will create the virtual service custom resource
thst is validated and deployed in k8s cluster
but as disvussed in ingress part, nothing will happen as there is no controller, as in this case there is no one watching the custom resource
so for this devops has to deploy the custom controller as per the given instructions in the official documentation of that service providers

for any custom resources
1. deploy the crd to extend the capabilities of  k8s cluster
2. deploy the custom controller
3. deploy the custom resource
similarly'by dfault inside the l8s cluster we have resource definition for deployment and we dont have deploy the crd for it
as a user we can create the deployment resource in out k8s cluster that is validated again the resource definition of deployment in k8s
and we dont have todeploy a controller for it as it is a native sresources k8s already has a controller for it by default


how one can write a custom controller?
 using golang and k8s is also created using golang
there is a component called client go in the k8s cluster and we will interact with client go and entire process depends on setting the watchers
by default k8s will watch for set of watchers like deploymen watchm service watcher and whenver thee is any update, creation these watchers will take action for
that specific resource
