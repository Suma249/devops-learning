What is Devops?

Devops is basically a practice that we are adopting in our organization that increases the organizations ability to deliver the application -> in general definition
ex:
an orginzation example.com is taking 10 days to introduce verion v2 from v1, just for one smal changes -> 10 days is not a good one

so, devops is the process of increasing the ability to deliver the applicatoions, its not only about delivering
its also about automation, quality, monitoring and testing

so, devops is a process of improving the application delivery by ensuring that there is a proper automation with the good quality that is maintained,and ensuring that there is continoius monitoring and testing

Why Devops?
before 10 years,
developers after wriring code will add that code in central locatio, system admin will create the server and they will deploy teh application on the server
and then tester would test the application, after this build and release engineer will take the application to the production envirpnment
System Administrator, Build and Release engineer, Server Admin => these three roles were involved in taking the application from developer to customer
server adminitrator will create the application server from where customer will access the application
so, because of this manual effort -> world of devops is evolved
