lets a our task is to execute  acalculator application as a container
docker file steps for application involves
 base image
 workdir
 installing dependencies
this is basic way, but this is not  good way. problem is that, we require only python run time to run this caculator function
but we have other things also like base image which itself will comes with lot of other dependencies
but for running the above python application, we dont need anything othe rtahn python runtime environmnet
base image and other thibgs are needed to build the application not for running the application and for running the application
we only need python runtime environment
to solve this problem, docker introduced somehing called multistage builds, as part of which we split our docker file
into 2 parts and it can be multiplie parts as well
in the first part we will add
 from ubuntu
 run
and we will take a binary from first part into second part, by this we are taking a minimal image(binary)
so for this we have two from statements and second from statement will have a runtime base image in our exanple
python runtime base image

ex:lets say we have an application that has frontend(react), backend(java) and db(mysql)

multistage build can have as many stages as we want but only the last stage is considered which is a minimalistic image

Distroless image: very minimalistic image that will only have runtime environment for the application
and for some application these distrolss images wont even have runtime environment ex: golang application
these images have advantage of security
