Software Development Cycle: phese include design, develop and testing

in any organization before a product is delivered to the end users, there are few phases that product has to go through
phases are:
planning, defining, designing, building, testing, deploy

Planning: prowduct oewner or BA will deal with planning or requirements phase, where they will get inputs from customers
Defining: clearly defining requirements in the documents(writing a document called software requirement specification document)
Designing: high level designing(defining like how many replicas to create, type of database, etc.,) and low level designing for the requirements that were given()
in below three phases where devops playes main role 
Building: developing the product according to the requirements. after writing the code, it will be pished to the common location where the complete application code is stpred
Testing: testing the application
Deployment: deploying the application onto the production server

so, devops will fastens the above three phases by ensuring that evrything happens in an automated way
