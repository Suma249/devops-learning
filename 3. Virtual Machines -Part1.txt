Virtual Machine?
lets say an organization has bought 5 servers, and the sysadmin has deployed app1 on server1 and app1 requires 4 GB RAM and 4 processors but server1 is having a 100 GB RAM  and 100 core
so it can seen that server is not being used efficiently
so thats why concept of virtualization came into picture, so now with the hep of virtulization concept
will indstall a hypervisor(it is a software that can install virtual machines on physical server) on server1, and we created a 5 servers on the server1 that is we are doing a logical partitioning
of server1, and each logical partition is called virtual machines
some of the popular hypervisors are VMWare, Xen, etc,.
so now team1 ca use vm1, team2 can use vm2,etc.,

convept of virtual machine is nothing but we are basically creating virtual environments that funcyion as virtual computer systems
breaking the physcal server into parts logically not physically

and each virtual computee has its own cpu, memory, hardware, etc.,

hypervisor is a key that is creating virtual machines

and the same concept is followed amazon, github and any other virtual machine or cloud platforms

what these clid platforms does is lets say amazon what they do is they build data centers.
lets say amazon has data center in x city and what this mreans is they take huge land and install a huge physical center there(like 100's or 1000's of physical servers)
and whenver user reqiests an amazon for virtual machine(ec2 instance) and select the region as x, then in the data center that is there is region x on on eof the physicak server
a hypervisor on a physical server will create a virtual machine for a user

servers are installed using rax
