why do we need ingress and what problem is it starting?
1. load balancing that service provides is the simple type but not the enterprise level load balancing
   problem: enterprise levl and tls load balancing is missing
2. we can expose our application to external world using load balancer mode, problem is lets say we have many services and for each of of the service
   if the type is load balancer, cloud provider was charging them more as the these ip addresses were public and static(service address is static and public)
   problem: service type of load balancer -> cloud provider will charge for each of the service of type load balancer

than k8s team to came up telling that it will allows k8s users to create a resource called ingress and the load balncers should something called
ingress controller, so in k8s cluster we can create a ingress yaml file sauing u need psth based routing, and path based routing implementation'is 
left to the load balancer and load balancer will create iingress controler and as k8s cluster user we will deploy the ingress controller using yaml
or helm chart, ingress controller will watch for ingress resource and it will provide us the path based routing
lets say we have k8s cluster and we are creating a pod using yaml manifest and as we know that there is a kubelet that will deploythe pod to 
one of the worker node, kublet will also sit on the worker node, api server will notify the kubelt using sheduler and kubelt will dpeloy 
the pod and similarly lets say we are creating a service yaml manifets, there is kube proxy and it will update the ip table rules
so for every resource that we are creating in k8s there is a componeht that is watching for it and perfroming a rqeuired action
similaly, even if we are creating a ingress in k8s there has to be resource or componnet or controller that has to watch for t
so this was the proble, so k8s team said thst it can create ingress resource, and also said that it is technically impossible to
implement the logic for all the load balancers availabke in the market, so it came up with the architectrure where user will create the ingress
resource and load balancing companies has to write their own ingrsss controllers and they will place the ingress controllers on github 
and they will provide the steps on how to install, 
and as a user instead of just creating the ingress user we also has todeploy the ingress controller
so ingress controller is a load balancer and sometimes it is a api gateway 

practical
1. continuing with the previous example setup
2. create ingress resource and setup host based load balancing
3. get the ingress resource example yaml from k8s official documentation
   create the ignress yaml with the same code and modify it as per ur need
   we need to provide the host name, path, service name and port details
4. deploye it -> kubectl apply -f ingress.yml
5. with this nothing will happen, for this to work we should install the ingress controllee
   we can use nginx for trying, minikube addons enable nginx -> installs the nginx controller
6. kubectl logs "controller name" -n "namespace"
